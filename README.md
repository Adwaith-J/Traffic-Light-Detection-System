Traffic Light Detection System

This project is a Traffic Light Detection System built with Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit. It detects the state of traffic lights — Red, Yellow, or Green — from uploaded images or video files. The app uses computer vision techniques such as color filtering and contour analysis to identify signals, and displays results directly on the media.
